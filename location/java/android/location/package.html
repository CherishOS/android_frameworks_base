<p>Contains framework API classes for accessing a variety of location related services.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The
<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/package-summary">Google Location Services APIs</a>,
part of Google Play services, is the preferred way to access location services for apps. These APIs
are both simpler to use and offer more capabilities as compared to the traditional Android location
APIs found here. They also offer new services, such as low-power geofencing, activity recognition,
and more. Clients of the traditional Android location APIs are encouraged to switch to the Google
Location Services APIs wherever possible.
