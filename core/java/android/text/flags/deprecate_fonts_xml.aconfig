  description: "Feature flag for deprecating fonts.xml. By setting true for this feature flag, the new font configuration XML, /system/etc/font_fallback.xml is used. The new XML has a new syntax and flexibility of variable font declarations, but it is not compatible with the apps that reads fonts.xml. So, fonts.xml is maintained as a subset of the font_fallback.xml"
