 *
 * An app must be {@link CompanionDeviceManager#associate associated} with at leas one device,

 *
 * You must declare this service in your manifest with an
 * intent-filter action of {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE} and
 * permission of {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_COMPANION_DEVICE_SERVICE}
 *
 * <p>If you want to declare more than one of these services, you must declare the meta-data in the
