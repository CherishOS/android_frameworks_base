/**
 * This class provides permission check APIs that verify both the
 * permission and the associated app op for this permission if
 * such is defined.
 * <p>
 * In the new permission model permissions with protection level
 * dangerous are runtime permissions. For apps targeting {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M}
 * and above the user may not grant such permissions or revoke
 * them at any time. For apps targeting API lower than {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M}
 * these permissions are always granted as such apps do not expect
 * permission revocations and would crash. Therefore, when the
 * user disables a permission for a legacy app in the UI the
 * platform disables the APIs guarded by this permission making
 * them a no-op which is doing nothing or returning an empty
 * result or default error.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is important that when you perform an operation on behalf of
 * another app you use these APIs to check for permissions as the
 * app may be a legacy app that does not participate in the new
 * permission model for which the user had disabled the "permission"
 * which is achieved by disallowing the corresponding app op.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class has two types of methods and you should be careful which
 * type to call based on whether permission protected data is being
 * passed to the app or you are just checking whether the app holds a
 * permission. The reason is that a permission check requires checking
 * the runtime permission and if it is granted checking the corresponding
 * app op as for apps not supporting the runtime mode we never revoke
 * permissions but disable app ops. Since there are two types of app op
 * checks, one that does not leave a record an action was performed and
 * another the does, one needs to call the preflight flavor of the checks
 * named xxxForPreflight only if no private data is being delivered but
 * a permission check is what is needed and the xxxForDataDelivery where
 * the permission check is right before private data delivery.
