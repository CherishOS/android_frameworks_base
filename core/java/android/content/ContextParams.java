/**
 * This class represents rules around how a context being created via
 * {@link Context#createContext} should behave.
 *
 * <p>One of the dimensions to customize is how permissions should behave.
 * For example, you can specify how permission accesses from a context should
 * be attributed in the platform's permission tracking system.
 *
 * <p>The two main types of attribution are: against an attribution tag which
 * is an arbitrary string your app specifies for the purposes of tracking permission
 * accesses from a given portion of your app; against another package and optionally
 * its attribution tag if you are accessing the data on behalf of another app and
 * you will be passing that data to this app. Both attributions are not mutually
 * exclusive.
 *
 * <p>For example if you have a feature "foo" in your app which accesses
 * permissions on behalf of app "foo.bar.baz" with feature "bar" you need to
 * create a context like this:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * context.createContext(new ContextParams.Builder()
 *     .setAttributionTag("foo")
 *     .setReceiverPackage("foo.bar.baz", "bar")
 *     .build())
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see Context#createContext(ContextParams)
