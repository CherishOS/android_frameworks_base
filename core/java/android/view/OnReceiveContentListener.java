/**
 * Listener for apps to implement handling for insertion of content. Content may be both text and
 * non-text (plain/styled text, HTML, images, videos, audio files, etc).
 *
 * <p>This listener can be attached to different types of UI components using
 * {@link View#setOnReceiveContentListener}.
 *
 * <p>Here is a sample implementation that handles content URIs and delegates the processing for
 * text and everything else to the platform:<br>
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * // (1) Define the listener
 * public class MyReceiver implements OnReceiveContentListener {
 *     public static final String[] MIME_TYPES = new String[] {"image/*", "video/*"};
 *
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public ContentInfo onReceiveContent(View view, ContentInfo payload) {
 *         Pair&lt;ContentInfo, ContentInfo&gt; split =
 *                 payload.partition(item -&gt; item.getUri() != null);
 *         ContentInfo uriContent = split.first;
 *         ContentInfo remaining = split.second;
 *         if (uriContent != null) {
 *             ClipData clip = uriContent.getClip();
 *             for (int i = 0; i < clip.getItemCount(); i++) {
 *                 Uri uri = clip.getItemAt(i).getUri();
 *                 // ... app-specific logic to handle the URI ...
 *             }
 *         }
 *         // Return anything that we didn't handle ourselves. This preserves the default platform
 *         // behavior for text and anything else for which we are not implementing custom handling.
 *         return remaining;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // (2) Register the listener
 * public class MyActivity extends Activity {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
 *         // ...
 *
 *         EditText myInput = findViewById(R.id.my_input);
 *         myInput.setOnReceiveContentListener(MyReceiver.MIME_TYPES, new MyReceiver());
 *     }
 * </pre>

public interface OnReceiveContentListener {
    /**
     * Receive the given content.
     *
     * <p>Implementations should handle any content items of interest and return all unhandled
     * items to preserve the default platform behavior for content that does not have app-specific
     * handling. For example, an implementation may provide handling for content URIs (to provide
     * support for inserting images, etc) and delegate the processing of text to the platform to
     * preserve the common behavior for inserting text. See the class javadoc for a sample
     * implementation and see {@link ContentInfo#partition} for a convenient way to split the
     * passed-in content.
     *
     * <p>If implementing handling for text: if the view has a selection, the selection should
     * be overwritten by the passed-in content; if there's no selection, the passed-in content
     * should be inserted at the current cursor position.
     *
     * <p>If implementing handling for non-text content (e.g. images): the content may be
     * inserted inline, or it may be added as an attachment (could potentially be shown in a
     * completely separate view).
     *
     * @param view The view where the content insertion was requested.
     * @param payload The content to insert and related metadata.
     *
     * @return The portion of the passed-in content whose processing should be delegated to
     * the platform. Return null if all content was handled in some way. Actual insertion of
     * the content may be processed asynchronously in the background and may or may not
     * succeed even if this method returns null. For example, an app may end up not inserting
     * an item if it exceeds the app's size limit for that type of content.
