 * Interface for applications to register back invocation callbacks. This allows the client
 * to customize various back behaviors by overriding the corresponding callback methods.

 * Callback instances can be added to and removed from {@link OnBackInvokedDispatcher}, held
 * by classes that implement {@link OnBackInvokedDispatcherOwner} (such as {@link Activity},
 * {@link Dialog} and {@link View}).
 *
 * Under the hood callbacks are registered at window level. When back is triggered,
 * callbacks on the in-focus window are invoked in reverse order in which they are added
 * within the same priority. Between different pirorities, callbacks with higher priority
 * are invoked first.
 *
 * See {@link OnBackInvokedDispatcher#registerOnBackInvokedCallback(OnBackInvokedCallback, int)}
 * for specifying callback priority.
