/**
 * Used to organize syncs for surfaces.
 *
 * The SurfaceSyncGroup allows callers to add desired syncs into a set and wait for them to all
 * complete before getting a callback. The purpose of the SurfaceSyncGroup is to be an accounting
 * mechanism so each sync implementation doesn't need to handle it themselves. The SurfaceSyncGroup
 * class is used the following way.
 *
 * 1. {@link #addToSync(SurfaceSyncGroup, boolean)} is called for every SurfaceSyncGroup object that
 * wants to be included in the sync. If the addSync is called for an {@link AttachedSurfaceControl}
 * or {@link SurfaceView} it needs to be called on the UI thread. When addToSync is called, it's
 * guaranteed that any UI updates that were requested before addToSync but after the last frame
 * drew, will be included in the sync.
 * 2. {@link #markSyncReady()} should be called when all the {@link SurfaceSyncGroup}s have been
 * added to the SurfaceSyncGroup. At this point, the SurfaceSyncGroup is closed and no more
 * SurfaceSyncGroups can be added to it.
 * 3. The SurfaceSyncGroup will gather the data for each SurfaceSyncGroup using the steps described
 * below. When all the SurfaceSyncGroups have finished, the syncRequestComplete will be invoked and
 * the transaction will either be applied or sent to the caller. In most cases, only the
 * SurfaceSyncGroup should be handling the Transaction object directly. However, there are some
 * cases where the framework needs to send the Transaction elsewhere, like in ViewRootImpl, so that
 * option is provided.
 *
 * The following is what happens within the {@link android.window.SurfaceSyncGroup}
 * 1. Each SurfaceSyncGroup will get a
 * {@link SurfaceSyncGroup#onAddedToSyncGroup(SurfaceSyncGroup, TransactionReadyCallback)} callback
 * that contains a  {@link TransactionReadyCallback}.
 * 2. Each {@link SurfaceSyncGroup} needs to invoke
 * {@link SurfaceSyncGroup#onTransactionReady(Transaction)}.
 * This makes sure the parent SurfaceSyncGroup knows when the SurfaceSyncGroup is complete, allowing
 * the parent SurfaceSyncGroup to get the Transaction that contains the changes for the child
 * SurfaceSyncGroup
 * 3. When the final TransactionReadyCallback finishes for the child SurfaceSyncGroups, the
 * transaction is either applied if it's the top most parent or the final merged transaction is sent
 * up to its parent SurfaceSyncGroup.
