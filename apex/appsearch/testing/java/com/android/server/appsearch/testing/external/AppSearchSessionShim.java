     * to {@link #setSchema}, if any, to determine how to treat existing documents. The following
     * types of schema modifications are always safe and are made without deleting any existing
     * documents:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Addition of new types

     *       type
     *   <li>Changing the cardinality of a data type to be less restrictive (e.g. changing an {@link
     *       AppSearchSchema.PropertyConfig#CARDINALITY_OPTIONAL OPTIONAL} property into a {@link
     *       AppSearchSchema.PropertyConfig#CARDINALITY_REPEATED REPEATED} property.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The following types of schema changes are not backwards-compatible:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Removal of an existing type
     *   <li>Removal of a property from a type
     *   <li>Changing the data type ({@code boolean}, {@code long}, etc.) of an existing property
     *   <li>For properties of {@code Document} type, changing the schema type of {@code Document}s
     *       of that property
     *   <li>Changing the cardinality of a data type to be more restrictive (e.g. changing an {@link
     *       AppSearchSchema.PropertyConfig#CARDINALITY_OPTIONAL OPTIONAL} property into a {@link
     *       AppSearchSchema.PropertyConfig#CARDINALITY_REQUIRED REQUIRED} property).
     *   <li>Adding a {@link AppSearchSchema.PropertyConfig#CARDINALITY_REQUIRED REQUIRED} property.
     * </ul>

     * future with an {@link android.app.appsearch.exceptions.AppSearchException} with a code of
     * {@link AppSearchResult#RESULT_INVALID_SCHEMA} and a message describing the incompatibility.
     * In this case the previously set schema will remain active.
     *
     * <p>If you need to make non-backwards-compatible changes as described above, you can set the
     * {@link SetSchemaRequest.Builder#setForceOverride} method to {@code true}. In this case,
     * instead of completing its future with an {@link

     * with the new schema will be deleted and the incompatible schema will be applied.

     *   <li>Exclusion
     *       <p>Exclude a term (e.g. “match documents that do not have the term ‘dog’”). Example:

     *       documents where the ‘subject’ property contains ‘important’”). Example:
     *       subject:important matches documents with the term ‘important’ in the ‘subject’ property
     *   <li>Schema type restricts
     *       <p>This is similar to property restricts, but allows for restricts on top-level
     *       document fields, such as schema_type. Clients should be able to limit their query to
     *       documents of a certain schema_type (e.g. “match documents that are of the ‘Email’
