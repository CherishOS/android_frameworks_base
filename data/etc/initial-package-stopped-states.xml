This XML defines an allowlist for packages that should not be scanned in a "stopped" state.
When this feature is turned on (indicated by the config config_stopSystemPackagesByDefault in
core/res/res/values/config.xml) packages on the system partition that are encountered by
the PackageManagerService for the first time are scanned in the "stopped" state. This allowlist
is also considered while creating new users on the device. Stopped state is not set during
subsequent reboots.

Example usage
    1. <initial-package-state package="com.example.app" stopped="false"/>
        Indicates that a system package - com.example.app's initial stopped state should not be set
        by the Package Manager. By default, system apps are marked as stopped.
    2. <initial-package-state package="com.example.app" stopped="true"/>
        Indicates that a system package - com.example.app's initial state should be set by the
        Package Manager to "stopped=true". It will have the same effect on the
        package's stopped state even if this package was not included in the allow list.
    3. <initial-package-state package="com.example.app"/>
        Invalid usage.
