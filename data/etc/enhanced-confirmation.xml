This XML defines an allowlist of packages that should be exempt from ECM (Enhanced Confirmation
Mode).

Example usage:

    <enhanced-confirmation-trusted-installer
         package="com.example.app"
         signature="E9:7A:BC:2C:D1:CA:8D:58:6A:57:0B:8C:F8:60:AA:D2:8D:13:30:2A:FB:C9:00:2C:5D:53:B2:6C:09:A4:85:A0"/>

This indicates that "com.example.app" should be exempt from ECM, and that, if "com.example.app" is
an installer, all packages installed via "com.example.app" will also be exempt from ECM.
