/**
 * A class to encapsulate information about an audio focus request.
 * An {@code AudioFocusRequest} instance is built by {@link Builder}, and is used to
 * request and abandon audio focus, respectively
 * with {@link AudioManager#requestAudioFocus(AudioFocusRequest)} and
 * {@link AudioManager#abandonAudioFocusRequest(AudioFocusRequest)}.
 * <p>In the context of describing audio focus, the term "ducking" is used. It describes a temporary
 * lowering of the audio level of an application in response to another application playing audio
 * concurrently. An example is during the playback of driving directions,
 * a user listening to music expects the music to "duck" during the playback of the message
 * announcing directions.
