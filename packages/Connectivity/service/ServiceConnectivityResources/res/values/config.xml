<!-- Configuration values for ConnectivityService
     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE for specific device configuration; instead, use a Runtime Resources
     Overlay package following the overlayable.xml configuration in the same directory:
     https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/rros -->
<resources>

    <!-- Configuration hook for the URL returned by ConnectivityManager#getCaptivePortalServerUrl.
         If empty, the returned value is controlled by Settings.Global.CAPTIVE_PORTAL_HTTP_URL,
         and if that value is empty, the framework will use a hard-coded default.
         This is *NOT* a URL that will always be used by the system network validation to detect
         captive portals: NetworkMonitor may use different strategies and will not necessarily use
         this URL. NetworkMonitor behaviour should be configured with NetworkStack resource overlays
         instead. -->
