/**
 * [SceneTransitionLayout] is a container that automatically animates its content whenever
 * [currentScene] changes, using the transitions defined in [transitions].
 *
 * Note: You should use [androidx.compose.animation.AnimatedContent] instead of
 * [SceneTransitionLayout] if it fits your need. Use [SceneTransitionLayout] over AnimatedContent if
 * you need support for swipe gestures, shared elements or transitions defined declaratively outside
 * UI code.
 *
 * @param currentScene the current scene
 * @param onChangeScene a mutator that should set [currentScene] to the given scene when called.
 *   This is called when the user commits a transition to a new scene because of a [UserAction], for
 *   instance by triggering back navigation or by swiping to a new scene.
 * @param transitions the definition of the transitions used to animate a change of scene.
 * @param state the observable state of this layout.
 * @param edgeDetector the edge detector used to detect which edge a swipe is started from, if any.
 * @param transitionInterceptionThreshold used during a scene transition. For the scene to be
 *   intercepted, the progress value must be above the threshold, and below (1 - threshold).
 * @param scenes the configuration of the different scenes of this layout.
