# Keyguard (aka Lockscreen)

Keyguard is responsible for:

1. Handling authentication to allow the user to unlock the device, via biometrics or [KeyguardBouncer][1]
2. Displaying informational content such as the time, notifications, and smartspace
3. Always-on Display (AOD)

Keyguard is the first screen available when turning on the device, as long as the user has not specified a security method of NONE.
